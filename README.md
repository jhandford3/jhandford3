## Hi there 👋

Hello! It's nice to meet you 👋
I am a problem solver, business operations manager at Posit PBC, and founder of Handford Hacks LLC.  
I love automating processes, working with financial data, and making beautiful charts. I also love the statistical programming language R, am a huge Gossip Girl fan, and traveling with my family is always an adventure.

I live in Charlotte, NC, with my husband, and two kids.

You can find me elsewhere at:
